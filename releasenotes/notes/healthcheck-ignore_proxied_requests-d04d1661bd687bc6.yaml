    The new ``[healthcheck] ignore_proxied_requests`` option has been added.
    When this option is set to true, the healthcheck middleware ignores
    requests with any of the following headers, which indicates that
    the requests came through a reverse proxy or a load balancer.

    - ``x-forwarded``
    - ``x-forwarded-proto``
    - ``x-forwarded-host``
    - ``x-forwarded-for``
    - ``x-forwarded-prefix``
