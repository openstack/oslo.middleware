    Adds a basic http auth middleware as an alternative to noauth in
    standalone environments. This middleware uses a password file which
    supports the Apache `htpasswd`_ syntax. This file is read for every
    request, so no service restart is required when changes are made.
    The only password digest supported is bcrypt, and the ``bcrypt``
    python library is used for password checks since it supports ``$2y$``
    prefixed bcrypt passwords as generated by the Apache htpasswd utility.
